# wait-for-service.sh

A lightweight script that waits for a critical HTTP-based service to become available before launching your Java application (JAR). Perfect for Docker and microservices where `depends_on` isnâ€™t enough.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Ensure services like Keycloak, databases with REST endpoints, or config servers are reachable before starting your dependent Java service.

---

## ðŸš€ Goal

Prevent container crashes or startup failures due to timing issues in Docker Compose by checking actual service availability.

---

## ðŸ”§ Usage

```bash
./wait-for-service.sh <host> <port> <url-path> <jar-name>
